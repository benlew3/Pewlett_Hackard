# Pewlett_Hackard

## Overview:
### Summary
In this project, we are utilizing SQL (pgAdmin) and Python to run an analysis on employees that are coming close to retirement eligibility. We want to know what the numbers are for those that are coming into the eligibility, what their titles are and what the impact will look like. Additionally we want to see what mentorship opportunities might be affected due to the mass retirement volume.

### Purpose:
We will be creating a database using a mix of Python, CSV files and SQL to identify who will be entering retirement eligibility. Our primary tasks are to identify the number of employees based on titles, and to identify who is eligible to participate in a mentorship program that would help mitigate soe of the issues of the mass retirement dubbed the "Silver Tsunami".

## Results 

### Analysis outcomes

#### Retiring titles
In part one of our task, we identify the number of employees retiring. In the following image, we can see that there are 6 titles that will have employees retiring and how many people per each title.<br>

From this image, we are able to tell which titles will be most impacted by retirement. From the chart, it shows that 29,414 senior engineers will are close to the retirement eligibility, and the least impacted from this chart are managers with only 2 people.

#### Mentorship Eligibility
In the chart below is a snippit on employees who are eligible for mentorship. This summary includes their age, name, birth dates and current title. In this particular query, we did a search on people who were born in the year 1965.<br>

Based on this data, there are a total of 300,024 employees currently employed by Perlett Hackard and of those, 90,398 employees are reaching the retirement age. This makes up roughly 30% of the company. The age range for the "Silver Tsunami" ranges from their birth years being between 1952-1955. Although many of them have been loyal employees for a long time, we can anticipate that within the next few years, there will be mass exedious of the older generational employees.

In the image above, we can see that 57,668 employees currently hold senior titles that are within the age range of the "Silver Tsunami". This can have a major company imact as 29,414 Sr Engineers and 28,254 Sr Staff will be retiring will leave with a large technical experience and knowedge. 

## Difficulties and Challenges

The main challenges I had encountered was to make sure the variables matched each other. Getting the right type of variable while connecting them to each other in the SQL table creation was the biggest challenge.

## Summary

Based on the generated data, we can identify that the major titles that have employees close to retirement are: Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, ASsistant Engineer, and Manager. 
For mentorship, there were roughly 1549 employees that were eligible for mentorship opportunities. This is could be a sever lack of knowledge for the future of Pewlett Hackard. 
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? I believe that with the number of those with retirement eligibility, we should utilize their skills and knowledge as soon as possible to raise those who are behind them. Especially those with a Senior in their title, which makes up almost 58,000 of the 90000 that are close to retirement. Ideally, those who were born in 1965, would join the mentorship with the "Silver Tsunami" group.
