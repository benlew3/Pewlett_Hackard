## Overview:
### Summary
In this project, we are utilizing SQL (pgAdmin) and Python to run an analysis on employees that are coming close to retirement eligibility. We want to know what the numbers are for those that are coming into the eligibility, what their titles are and what the impact will look like. Additionally we want to see what mentorship opportunities might be affected due to the mass retirement volume.

### Purpose:
We will be creating a database using a mix of Python, CSV files and SQL to identify who will be entering retirement eligibility. Our primary tasks are to identify the number of employees based on titles, and to identify who is eligible to participate in a mentorship program that would help mitigate soe of the issues of the mass retirement dubbed the "Silver Tsunami".

## Analysis / Results 

### Analysis outcomes

#### Retiring titles
In part one of our task, we identify the number of employees retiring. In the following image, we can see that there are 6 titles that will have employees retiring and how many people per each title.

From this image, we are able to tell which titles will be most impacted by retirement. From the chart, it shows that 29,414 senior engineers will are close to the retirement eligibility, and the least impacted from this chart are managers with only 2 people.

#### Mentorship Eligibility
In the chart below is a snippit on employees who are eligible for mentorship. This summary includes their age, name, birth dates and current title. In this particular query, we did a search on people who were born in the year 1965.
